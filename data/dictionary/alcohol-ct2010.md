### Liquor Authority Permit Data Overview#### General Description
The State Liquor Authority (SLA) regulates the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages.  The SLA maintains offices in New York City, Albany (which serves as the agency headquarters), and Buffalo.  The SLA’s Licensing Bureau is responsible for the statewide processing of licenses, license renewals, permits and brand label registrations.  All must be consistent with the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law.#### Data Collection Methodology
Base information corresponds to that provided, by applicants, on various permit applications.  Processing time is contingent upon review within the Licensing Bureau.#### Statistical and Analytical Issues
Information is entered into the agency’s workflow system as permits are received.  Correlations could be made for different variables as a user of the data assesses the information.#### Limitations of Data Use
The data is straight forward and indicates the facts associated with each permit request.
