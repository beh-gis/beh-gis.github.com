###Walkability Index Scale
A number of researchers have constructed walkability indices which summarize built environment features believed to promote walking. Although specification details vary, these indices typically include measures of population density, land use, and street network. Our walkability measure was adapted from that employed in recent papers by Frank and colleagues (2005 and 2006), which includes four components: residential population density (density of population per total residential land area), intersection density, an entropy measure of land use based on the distribution of building floor area among six land use types (education, entertainment, single-family residential, multi-family residential, retail, and office), and the retail floor area ratio, or the ratio of retail building floor area to retail land area. All of the Frank components were z-scored and summed, with intersection density receiving a double weight for the Frank Scale, but not for our scale. Our “BEH walkability scale” is documented in a paper by Neckerman and colleagues (2009).
